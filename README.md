Swiggy Review Intelligence Platform
Project Overview
The Swiggy Review Intelligence Platform is an AI-driven analytics solution designed to transform unstructured customer feedback into actionable business intelligence. By integrating semantic search with Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), the platform enables stakeholders to identify operational bottlenecks, sentiment trends, and specific service failures through a conversational interface and interactive dashboard.

Key Features
Review Preprocessing: Automated cleaning and normalization of raw customer feedback.
Sentiment and Aspect Tagging: High-precision classification of reviews based on emotional tone and service categories (e.g., delivery speed, food quality).
Semantic Search: FAISS-powered vector database allowing for contextual retrieval of reviews beyond simple keyword matching.
RAG-based AI Assistant: A natural language interface for querying complex patterns such as refund issues or support quality.
Interactive Dashboard: A comprehensive Streamlit interface for visualizing high-level analytics and granular reports.
System Architecture
The system follows a modular architecture to separate data ingestion, vector storage, and the application layer.

File Structure
app.py: Main entry point for the Streamlit dashboard.

analytics.py: Core logic for generating visual insights and trend data.

rag_chain.py: LLM orchestration and RAG pipeline management.

retriever.py: Functions for querying the vector store.

faiss_store/: Directory containing the local vector database (index.faiss, metadata.pkl).

pages/: Multi-page Streamlit application structure.

2_AI_Assistant.py: Interface for the RAG chatbot.

4_Reports_Alerts.py: Module for automated reporting and critical alerts.

utils/: Directory for modular helper scripts (analytics_utils.py, rag_utils.py, retriever_utils.py).

Setup and Installation
1. Repository Initialization
git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/<repo-name>.git
cd <repo-name>
2. Virtual Environment Configuration
Windows:

python -m venv venv
venv\Scripts\activate
Mac/Linux:

python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
3. Dependency Installation
pip install -r requirements.txt
4. Environment Variables
To enable AI functionalities, configure your API keys as environment variables. Windows:

set GROQ_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
Mac/Linux:

export GROQ_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
5. Vector Store Initialization
Ensure that the faiss_store/ directory contains the required index files. If the files are missing, run the build script:

python build_faiss.py
6. Execution
streamlit run app.py
Deployment Guidelines
Cloud Hosting: Use CPU-optimized builds for libraries like Torch to comply with Streamlit Cloud resource limits.
API Security: Ensure .env files or hardcoded keys are not included in version control.
Data Management: Maintain FAISS index files under 100 MB for faster loading and deployment stability.
Path Management: Always utilize relative paths wi
